Regression Test Types
---------------------

The following rules can be made from within each regression test:

Rule            Description
--------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
referenceBuild  Builds a reference kremlin.bin.
referenceCheck  Compiles and runs the program. Then diffs against the
                reference kremlin.bin.
sregionsBuild   Builds a reference sregions.txt
sregionsCheck   Compiles and diffs against the reference sregions.txt
valgrindCheck   Compiles and runs valgrind on the test. Fails if any invalid
                memory accesses or leaks occur.

Running the Regression Suite
----------------------------
Any of the rules can be run across all tests by appending "All" to the rule.
For example, to run referenceCheck across all tests, run 

    make referenceCheckAll

Directory Layout
----------------

All subdirectories with Makefiles are regression tests.

All test makefiles must print "FAILED" to stdout or stderr if they fail.
They also fail if they do not build the rule successfully. That is, they will
return a non-zero exit code.
